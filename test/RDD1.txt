Apache Spark has evolved significantly since I first started the project at UC Berkeley
in 2009 After moving to the Apache Software Foundation the open source project
has had over 1,400 contributors from hundreds of companies and the global Spark
meetup group has grown to over half a million members Spark’s user base has also
become highly diverse encompassing Python R SQL and JVM developers with use
cases ranging from data science to business intelligence to data engineering I have
been working closely with the Apache Spark community to help continue its development and I am thrilled to see the progress thus far 
The release of Spark 3 0 marks an important milestone for the project and has

sparked the need for updated learning material The idea of a second edition of
Learning Spark has come up many times—and it was overdue Even though I coauthored both Learning Spark and Spark: The Definitive Guide  both O’Reilly  it was
time for me to let the next generation of Spark contributors pick up the narrative I’m
delighted that four experienced practitioners and developers who have been working
closely with Apache Spark from its early days have teamed up to write this second
edition of the book incorporating the most recent APIs and best practices for Spark
developers in a clear and informative guide
